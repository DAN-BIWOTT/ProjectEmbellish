Dear Dan,

Seeing as you have not responded to the emails I sent before, I have decided to do a comprehensive one.

1. Rebrand;
We are no longer Embellish and Emblazon, we are now Embellish; The Lawyer of the Future. I will send a picture shortly with the details of the logo and placement

2. About
Embellish is a group of young lawyers -and other professionals- who are prepared to take the bull by its horns and champion progressive thinking, exchange of ideas and networking in all forms. What makes us different is that we do not just stop at ideas, but aim at taking action

Our core goal is to effect social change using both conventional and unconventional routes availed to us by our training and interests. 

Our activities include quarterly Roundtable meetups, an annual gala dinner, as well as various short-term community impact projects throughout the year. 

Part of our output is a quarterly publication on emerging areas of law and other pertinent issues as well as a Podcast capturing current affairs, governance, and other areas of interest.

3. Who May Join?
We are open to all professionals with a keen interest in impacting the society beyond their day-to-day role. We particularly welcome young professionals keen on meeting other like-minded individuals and sharing ideas. 

4. How to Join
Embellish exists entirely online. We have a WhatsApp channel, as well as social media handles including X, Instagram, LinkedIn and TikTok. You may join our mailing list for updates on what members of the community are up to, our activities, opportunities and more.
